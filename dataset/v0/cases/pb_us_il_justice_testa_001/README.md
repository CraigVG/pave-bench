# pb_us_il_justice_testa_001 — Justice IL (Testa Dr)

The first real-imagery PaveBench case: a large, empty, crisply striped office
parking lot with ~30 landscape-island cutouts, a building, and a retention pond.

## Review status: needs_gold_review

This case is **not benchmark truth yet.** The gold geometry was hand-traced by
Craig on Google imagery and then projected onto the Cook County ortho by
`pavebench case-from-propaving` (linear WGS84 -> pixel mapping over the analysis
box). Two things a reviewer must confirm before promoting to `reviewed_gold`:

1. **Georegistration offset.** Google-traced geometry sits ~2-3 m off
   survey-grade orthos. Overlaying the gold on `image.png` shows the boundary a
   touch outside the real curb and the island rings shifted up-left by a couple
   metres. Adjust (shift/rubber-sheet) or re-trace against this ortho.
2. **Cutout completeness.** All 30 islands were carried over; verify each lands
   on a real planter and none are missing at this resolution.

Regenerate the review overlay with:

```python
import json
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
m = json.load(open("metadata.json"))
img = Image.open("image.png").convert("RGB")
d = ImageDraw.Draw(img, "RGBA")
b = [(p[0], p[1]) for p in m["gold"]["boundary"]]
d.line(b + [b[0]], fill=(0, 255, 255, 255), width=5)
for c in m["gold"]["cutouts"]:
    ring = [(p[0], p[1]) for p in c]
    d.line(ring + [ring[0]], fill=(255, 80, 0, 255), width=3)
img.save("review-overlay.png")
```

## Why this lot matters

It is the ProPaving founder's gold lot and the hardest imagery lesson in the
research: Esri World Imagery has no high-res tiles here (z19 native, 22 cm/px),
so it is unusable for stall stripes — but the **free** Cook County public-domain
ortho resolves it. This case exists to prove the benchmark can run on legal,
redistributable, reproducible imagery instead of Google.
